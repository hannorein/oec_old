	<description>The Kepler-20 system hosts at least five transiting exo-planets. Kepler-20 b has a period of only 3.7 days. Because it is about twice as big as the Earth, it is classified as a super-Earth or sub-Neptune. Kepler-20 b's composition is ambiguous. It could be a terrestrial planet with a rocky surface or it could have a significant gas envelope.</description>
