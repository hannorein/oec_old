	<description>The rapidly pulsating eclipsing binary NY Vir has a period of 0.1 days. On a much longer timescale of 7.9 years, the system exhibits small amplitude cyclic variations which are associated with a third body in the system. A recent paper by Qian et al claims that this body is a giant circumbinary planet orbiting NY Vir at a distance of 3.3 astronomical units. There might be another planet in this system with an even longer orbital period, probably more than 15 years.</description>
