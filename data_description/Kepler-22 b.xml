	<description>Kepler-22b is a planet orbiting the Kepler target star KIC10593626 and has been discovered with the Kepler spacecraft. It is orbiting a solar type star and its period is close to 300 days. This puts it in the habitable zone with an equilibrium temperature of minus 11 degrees Celsius (plus 11 degrees Fahrenheit). If the planet has an atmosphere similar to that of Earth then the surface temperature is 22 degrees Celsius (71 degrees Fahrenheit). Kepler-22b is the smallest radius planet known to orbit in the habitable zone of any star other than the Sun.</description>
