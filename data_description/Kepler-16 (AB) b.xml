	<description>Kepler-16 (AB) b is a circum-binary planet. It is orbiting two stars. The visualizations below are therefore not accurate. The masses of the stars are 0.20255 and 0.6897 solar masses. The orbit of the binary stars and the planet are perfectly alligned within half a degree. This suggests that the planet formed in a circumbinary disc. </description>
