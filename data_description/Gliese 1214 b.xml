	<description>Gliese 1214 is a red dwarf in the constellation Ophiuchus only 40 light years away. The planet was found with a 40cm telescope and commercially available cameras. New observations from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope show that it is a waterworld enshrouded by a thick, steamy atmosphere. GJ1214b represents a new type of planet, like nothing seen in our solar system or any other planetary system currently known.</description>
