	<description>The star Gliese 433 is a red dwarf in the constellation Hydro. The radial velocity data shows an additional signal with a period of 10 years. However, due to a strong correlation with various activity indicators of the star, it is most likely due to a magnetic cycle and not a planet. The cycle is similar to the Sun's 11 year cycle.</description>
