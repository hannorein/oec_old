			<description>HD 10180 is a solar type star in the constellation Hydrus. The planetary system contains at least five planets with masses comparable to the ice giants in the solar system. There might be a further Earth mass planet, which is currently awaiting confirmation. The planets in this system are in near resonance. The age of the star is 7.3 Giga years. The planets have been discovered with the HARPS spectrograph at the La Silla Observatory in Chile.</description>
