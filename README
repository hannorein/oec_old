The interesting stuff is in `systems` directory. Each xml file corresponds to a planetary system. The dataformat should be rather self-explanatory.

You can add, update and delete files in the systems directory. Then run the `doEverything.bash` script. This will commit everything and create some datafiles for old versions of the Exoplanet App (everything in the `data_*` directories. It will also create the files in `systems/iphone` which are downloaded by the iPhone app.
