	<description>This planet candidate was discovered with the Kepler spacecraft. Because there are multiple phenomena that can create a signal that looks similar to a planetary transit, the candidates have to be confirmed with another method. For Kepler-32 the planetary nature of the companions has been confirmed by transit timing variations, caused by other planets in the system, and a stability analysis. However, the mass of the planets is not well constrained yet. There are at least three other unconfirmed planets in the system. </description>
