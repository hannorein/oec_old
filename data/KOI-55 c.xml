	<description>The planet KOI-55 c is orbiting a former red-giant star. It probably survived deep immersion in the red-giant envelope. When the star ran out of hydrogen after about 10 billion years, it swelled dramatically. Our own sun will also undergo this phase and expand all the way to the Earth's orbit. The planet that we see today in the KOI-55 system might just be the dense corse of an evaporated giant planet which survived the dead of its sun. Although the planet was discovered with the Kepler spacecraft, it does not transit. The planet is inferred because of the brightness pulsations.</description>
